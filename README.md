# *Helianthus*: Sign-up Form

This is a sign-up form created for a fictional service - *helianthus*. The goal was to practice creating HTML forms and styling them using CSS. Flexbox was used to style the basic layout of the webpage. The email input field performs in-built validation on the format of input. The password fields validate the length of the password.
